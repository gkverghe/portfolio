          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-slate-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <p>
              I'm a Senior Product Manager with 5+ years building and scaling internal BI, analytics, and AI-powered
              platforms. My work focuses on products used by hundreds of cross-functional teams to explore data,
              make decisions, and ship with confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              My background spans engineering (Electrical Engineering) and business (MBA, Queen's University),
              with experience across finance, analytics, and product. This combination helps me bridge technical
              depth with business strategy—I can go deep on data architecture with engineers and translate
              impact to executives in the same conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              What excites me most right now is the intersection of AI and data platforms. I've led 0→1 products
              in Text-to-SQL, LLM-assisted analytics, and multi-agent orchestration. I believe we're at an
              inflection point where AI will fundamentally change how organizations interact with data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I build side projects with my 5-year-old as my lead product advisor (he has strong
              opinions about game mechanics). I'm always looking for opportunities to build platforms that make
              data more accessible and decisions more confident.
            </p>
